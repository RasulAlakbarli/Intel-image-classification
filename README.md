# Introduction
Intel image dataset consist of images of Natural Scenes around the world. The data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. This repository consist of number of algorithms for classifying the dataset. The goal of this repo is to compare algotithms and analyse results to find the best model for solving this problem.

# Description
Full repo will consist of these models:
1. AlexNet ☑️
2. ResNet 
3. VGG-16 
4. Inception 
5. MobileNetV2

# Results
### AlexNet 
Results of 85% train and 85% validation accuracies were obtained. Model contains total of 30 million parameters.

### ResNet 
Results of 85% train and 71% validation accuracies were obtained. During training, inconsistencies in validation accuracy were observed. The model will be improved. Model contains total of 23 million parameters.

### VGG-16
