# Introduction
Intel image dataset consist of images of Natural Scenes around the world. The data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. This repository consist of number of algorithms for classifying the dataset. The goal of this repo is to compare algotithms and analyse results to find the best model for solving this problem.

# Description
Full repo will consist of these algorithms:
1. AlexNet ☑️
2. ResNet 
3. VGG-16 
4. Inception 
5. MobileNetV2

# Results
### AlexNet 
After training, 95% train and 85% (temporarily) validation accuracy scores were obtained. Model contains total of 30 million parameters.
