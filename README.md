# Introduction
Intel image dataset consists of images of Natural Scenes around the world. The data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. This repository consists of a number of algorithms for classifying the dataset. The goal of this repo is to compare algorithms and analyze results to find the best model for solving this problem.

# Description
The full repo will consist of these models:
1. AlexNet ‚òëÔ∏è
2. ResNet ‚òëÔ∏è
3. VGG-16 

# Results
### AlexNet 
Results of 85% training and 82% validation accuracies were obtained. The model contains a total of 30 million parameters.

### ResNet 
Results of 85% training and 71% validation accuracies were obtained. During training, inconsistencies in validation accuracy were observed. The model will be improved. The model contains a total of 23 million parameters.

### VGG-16 
Coming soon...üòâ
